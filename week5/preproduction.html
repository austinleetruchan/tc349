	<h2> Card Sort </h2>
	<p>I began by writing down the different sorts of content I wanted to include in my site on cards. I then had my three roommates and myself rearrange the cards based on usability, correct informaiton architecture and simplicity. Since there isn't a whole lot of content with the site, our arrangements were all basically the same. The finished card sort that ended up using can be seen in the pics below... </p>
